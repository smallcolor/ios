[Bug fixes](https://github.com/cloudapp/ios/issues/) are always welcome. If you want to add new features please wait until we publish a roadmap next week.

###Contribute

If you'd like to hack on CloudApp iOS, start by forking our repo on GitHub:

[http://github.com/cloudapp/ios](http://github.com/cloudapp/ios/)

The best way to get your changes merged back into core is as follows:

1. Clone down your fork
2. Create a thoughtfully named topic branch to contain your change
3. Hack away
4. If you are adding new functionality, document it in the README
5. Do not change the version number, we will do that on our end
6. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors
7. Push the branch up to GitHub
8. Send [us](http://github.com/cloudapp/) a pull request for your branch
